# My configuration
I always wanted to automate my home, but product prices in France for devices like Fibaro or Z-wave are too expensive.
Since this summer, I knew Xiaomi brand and all cheap products available to make my dreams true!
So my installation is full based on Xiaomi products and free home automation system.

I use following parts:
- Xiaomi Gateway v2
  - For controlling all Xiaomi devices with ZigBee protocol
- Domoticz on a Raspberry Pi 3
  - The free home automation system
- Devices
  - Xiaomi Yeelight RGBW
  - Xiaomi Yeelight White
  - Xiaomi Yeelight Strip
  - Xiaomi Aqara Windows Door Sensor
  - Xiaomi Aqara Temperature Humidity Sensor
  - Xiaomi Aqara Human Body Sensor
  - Xiaomi Mi Magic Controller
  - Xiaomi Aqara Smart Light Switch
